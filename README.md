## 
<br>We'll use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.

The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.


- **DATASET:** Available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)


##  &nbsp;
**This project involved:**

- 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐜𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 & 𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: I imported the libraries like Pandas and utilized functions like drop and fillna to handle missing values within the Titanic dataset.

- 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 (𝐄𝐃𝐀): I performed the data cleaning, filtering, and tackled NaN values. Statistical measures and data visualization using Matplotlib helped uncover patterns and trends. I created the visualizations like count plots to analyze survival rates.

- 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭:  I implemented the Logistic Regression as a classification model to predict passenger survival based on features extracted from the dataset.

- 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The data was split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. This ensured robust model performance.

**This project allowed me to solidify my understanding of:**

- 𝐄𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧 𝐋𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Scikit-learn (likely used) for Logistic Regression.

- 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬: Handling missing values and preparing data for analysis.

- 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Building a classification model and assessing its effectiveness.
  

<br>Excited to continue learning and applying my skills in Python and data analysis! ✨
